## Overview

The main idea behind this project was to build an app that prevented short-sighted, emotional investing. That being the case, users can search for stocks, save them to their sidenav, and view data focused on long-term performance, which hopefully encourages more rational, informed decision-making.

## Features

  - Searchable list of over 28,000 stock symbols (lazy-loaded for performance)
  - Server-side rendered (SSR) components for fast, SEO-friendly pages
  - Long-term focused stock data from reliable financial APIs
  -  Saved stock watchlist in a collapsible side navigation

## Data Sources

  - Polygon.io – real-time and historical market data
  - Finnhub.io – financials, metrics, and company profiles
